 * Json-b adapter to transform a (UTC) ZonedDateTime and epoch seconds.

 * A JSON numeric value representing the number of seconds from
 * 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC until the specified UTC date/time, ignoring leap
 * seconds. This is equivalent to the IEEE Std 1003.1, 2013 Edition [POSIX.1]
 * definition "Seconds Since the Epoch", in which each day is accounted for by
 * exactly 86400 seconds, other than that non-integer values can be represented.

 * particular.
